			<div>
				<p>I am a Backend developer passionate about creating something unique and useful. I work on a variety of projects, from trendy AI and Blockchain projects to simple Telegram and Discord bots. Currently, I work as a Backend Cloud Developer at Deutsche Telekom in Munich. Alongside my job, I am constantly brainstorming startup ideas and opportunities for personal development as a developer.</p>
<p>Apart from programming, I enjoy reading books, traveling, and space. I love pondering the hope that we are not alone in the universe.</p>
<p>My programming journey began at the age of 12 when I took frontend development courses. After successfully completing them, I decided to continue as a web developer and enrolled in backend development courses, marking the beginning of my serious journey into IT. After mastering JavaScript, I decided to delve into something more challenging and started learning C++. This greatly helped me in college, where I not only learned alongside my peers but also assisted my instructor in conducting lectures.</p>
<p>A life-changing event occurred when I met Daniel while playing Apex Legends. He, too, was a programmer and became my mentor and best friend, helping me overcome all the challenges along the way. Привет Даня!</p>
<p>Perhaps I will add more here later; I need to integrate an API so that I can update my bio through a Telegram bot.</p>
